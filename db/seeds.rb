#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# default admin user - CHANGE PASSWORD!!!

<li>You may not do anything to diminish the competition experience for other players on the system; 
if you are worried that you might break something, ask an operator in IRC (with a private message) for clarification. 
We love creativity, just clear it with us first.</li>\r\n
<li>Foul play will not be tolerated (first offense is a warning, second offense is an appropriate point deduction and 
third offense is a disqualification).</li>\r\n<li>No bullying. This includes harassment, intimidation and threats.</li>\r\n
<li>Operator decisions are final.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Etiquette</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n
<li>Keep it clean in IRC and MPAA G-rated conversations, please.</li>\r\n
<li>Remember that operators in IRC channel are running the game.</li>\r\n
<li>Be a good sport throughout the competition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Flag Format</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n
<li>All flags are either of the form MCA-[8 hex digits] such as MCA-ABCDEF12 or an SHA1 hash.</li>\r\n
<li>Case does not matter when submitting to the scoreboard, it will downcase your submission automatically.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n
<p><strong>Challenge Colors</strong></p>\r\nChallenges will sometimes show up as different colors, the possible colors and 
their meanings are as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b style=\"color:green;\">Green:</b> Available and ready to be solved by your team.</li>\r\n
